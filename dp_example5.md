# Example 5

# Tennis Serve

## Problem

The analysis we had done for batsman the same can be done for a tennis player.

Usually a tennis player can have 2 types of serve

1. Fast serve

   Usually this serve is the better one and difficult to be hit back but it comes with a high risk, i.e. it is also difficult to land in the correct area. So it has high risk but better result

2. Slow serve 

â€‹		Usually it is easier to land this serve but also easy for the player to hit back. Giving low risk and poor result

It depends upon the situation of the game

The scoring pattern in tennis is quite difficult to imagine {15,30,40,win}. For simplicity we can take the scoring pattern to {0,1,2,3,4}.

This problem is similar to what shot a batsman must play at the given stage, so we can solve it by calculating probability and forming dp equation.
