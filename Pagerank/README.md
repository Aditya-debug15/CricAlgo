## Player of the match (IN POM FOLDER)

Earlier the procedure to select the player of the match was according to a point system, where for each run batsman was given 1 point and for each wicket taken bowler was given 25 points. This system lacked the impact the player's performance was sometime the bowler might take 2 wickets but those 2 were better batsman whereas some other bowler who took 5 wickets of batsman that didn't score much score would have high points. Now to select the player of the match they do a voting between their panel of cricket experts to choose the player. This is often emotional and highly subjective therefore i tried to find the man of the match using the PageRank algorithm.

## Most Valuable Batter (IN MVB FOLDER)

From the data of partnerships in the current season we can figure out which batter is the most valuable to the team.

## Breaking Ties (IN Team_ranking folder)

In case of ties in knockout games, it is essential to determine a winner. In football they have extra-time and penalty which though is a better way to determine the result but in cricket we have super-over. To determine the outcome of a 50 over match we play a single over match doesn't seem to be a nice idea. I think we can use their rank (calculated by PageRank Algorithm) based on the matches played in group stage to decide the winner.

## In short
Using PageRank to find the most valuable batter, player of the match and breaking ties through group matches result.
