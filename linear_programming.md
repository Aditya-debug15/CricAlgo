# Linear Programming

Linear programming (LP, also called linear optimization) is **a method to achieve the best outcome** (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.

## Components of Linear Programming

The basic components of the LP are as follows:

- Decision Variables
- Constraints
- Data
- Objective Functions



## Characteristics of Linear Programming

The following are the five characteristics of the linear programming problem:

Constraints – The limitations should be expressed in the mathematical form, regarding the resource.

**The constrains in my problem are:**

- 1<= All rounders <=4
- 1<= wicket-keepers <=4
- 3 <= Batter <=6 
- 3 <= Bowlers <=6 
- 4<= Players from team A <=7
- 4<= Players from team B <=7
- Total credit points of the team should not exceed 100

Objective Function – In a problem, the objective function should be specified in a quantitative way.

​	**In my problem we need to maximize the ROI score.**

Linearity – The relationship between two or more variables in the function must be linear. It means that the degree of the variable is one.

Finiteness – There should be finite and infinite input and output numbers. In case, if the function has infinite factors, the optimal solution is not feasible. 

Non-negativity – The variable value should be positive or zero. It should not be a negative value.

Decision Variables – The decision variable will decide the output. It gives the ultimate solution of the problem. For any problem, the first step is to identify the decision variables.

**In my problem there are 22 decision variables (11 player from team A and 11 player from team B) ** out of these 22, 11 decision variables ahve value 1 and 11 decision variable have value 0. This can also be a constrain.
